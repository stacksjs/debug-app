## Design

_This section discusses some of the design choices made for Inter._

Inter can be classified as a geometric neo-grotesque, similar in style to Roboto, Apple San Francisco, Akkurat, Asap, Lucida Grande and more. Some trade-offs were made in order to make this typeface work really well at small sizes:

- Early versions of Inter was not suitable for very large sizes because of some small-scale glyph optimizations (like "pits" and "traps") that help rasterization at small sizes but stand out and interfere at large sizes. However today Inter works well at large sizes and a [Display subfamily](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/display-beta-1) is in the works for really large "display" sizes.

- Rasterized at sizes below 12px, some stems—like the horizontal center of "E", "F", or vertical center of "m"—are drawn with two semi-opaque pixels instead of one solid. This is because we "prioritize" (optimize for) higher-density rasterizations. If we move these stems to an off-center position—so that they can be drawn sharply at e.g. 11px—text will be less legible at higher resolutions.

Inter is a [variable font](https://rsms.me/inter/#variable) and is in addition also distributed as a set of traditional distinct font files in the following styles:

| Roman (upright) name | Italic name          | Weight
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------
| Thin                 | Thin Italic          | 100
| Extra Light          | Extra Light Italic   | 200
| Light                | Light Italic         | 300
| Regular              | Italic               | 400
| Medium               | Medium Italic        | 500
| Semi Bold            | Semi Bold Italic     | 600
| Bold                 | Bold Italic          | 700
| Extra Bold           | Extra Bold Italic    | 800
